<p id="intro">The purpose of The Pingry Book Exchange is to improve the Pingry community
by allowing students to easily buy and sell used schoolbooks from each
other in a cost-efficient manner. It is to the discretion of the students
to negotiate the price and decide upon the location of the exchange. This
way, students have the flexibility to accommodate purchases to fit to their
own schedules and locations.
